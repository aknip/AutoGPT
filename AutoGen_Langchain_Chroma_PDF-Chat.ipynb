These AutoGen agents can be tailored to specific needs, engage in conversations, and seamlessly integrate human participation. They are adaptable to different operation modes that encompass the utilization of LLMs, human inputs, and various tools.\n",

            " Uniswap v3 is a noncustodial automated market maker implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It provides increased capital efficiency and fine-tuned control to liquidity providers, improves the accuracy and convenience of the price oracle, and has a more flexible fee structure. Liquidity providers are given the ability to concentrate their liquidity by “bounding\" it within an arbitrary price range. The swap fee is no longer locked at 0.30%. To use Uniswap v3, liquidity providers can add their capital to a pool and set the desired price range and fee.\n",
