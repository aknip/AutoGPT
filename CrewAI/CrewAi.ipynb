The report also touches on AI’s inability to handle more complex tasks.Despite marked concern over the technology’s capabilities, developers remain optimistic about its positive effects on productivity. Four in five (81%) noted increased productivity as the primary benefit, with 71% of new coders stating the tech helps accelerate their learning.“In the last year, it’s become clear that while GenAI is an incredibly powerful tool, it is not a catch all for the problem technologists and enterprises aim to solve,\" Stack Overflow Chief Product Officer Ryan Polk summarized.On the flip side, may developers are still worried about AI’s potential to circulate misinformation (79%), missing or incorrect attribution for sources of data (65%) and bias (50%).Are you a pro?

      "Mark Zuckerberg claims open-source is 'necessary for a positive AI future' | TechRadar Skip to main content (Image credit: Meta) Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for an open-source future for generative AI in a new essay. He argues that an open-source ecosystem benefits consumers globally and encourages innovation, indirectly throwing a rhetorical gauntlet at the feet of closed-source developers (and Meta competitors) like OpenAI and Google. “Meta’s business model is about building the best experiences and services for people,” Zuckerberg wrote. “To do this, we must ensure that we always have access to the best technology, and that we’re not locking into a competitor’s closed ecosystem where they can restrict what we build.”The principle behind open-source models is that they allow for a collaborative approach to development. Unlike closed-source models, which are restricted to a company’s internal team and its customers, open-source models can be accessed, modified, and improved by anyone. To smartphone owners, the difference can be seen when comparing Apple’s proprietary iOS and Google’s open-source Android operating system. Android is thus available on all kinds of devices, while iOS is limited to Apple devices.In AI, closed-source models, like those from OpenAI and Google, are typically only available to a company’s customers and offer limited opportunities for modification. These models are designed to protect intellectual property and maintain control over the technology’s use.According to Zuckerberg, developers benefit from having an open-source framework for AI. He contended that by making AI models available to a wide range of developers and researchers, the technology can be refined more rapidly and effectively. This would lead to improvements in both security and overall functionality, as more eyes on the code would help identify and fix flaws faster than in a closed system.AI Open vs. OpenAIA common counter-argument against open-sourcing AI is that bad\n",
      "\n",
      "actors might use it maliciously or that adversarial nations might undermine the national security of rival countries with the technology. Zuckerberg acknowledged that but pushed back by saying closed-source models are not immune to such risks, as their code can also be stolen and used. Instead, he advocated U.S. companies working with the government and adopting an open-source approach.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Meta is already pursuing an open-source strategy with its Llama AI model portfolio. In the essay, Zuckerberg announced the latest version, Llama 3.1, claiming that it is one of the most advanced models available thanks in part to being open-source. Meta and Zuckerberg claim that by sharing such tools, they can better democratize AI development and ensure that its benefits are widely distributed. Zuckerberg believes that by making AI models open-source, a larger and more diverse group of developers can contribute to their development, potentially leading to more robust and secure systems.The debate over open-source and closed-source models is likely to shape the future of AI development. For now, it looks like they may coexist like other kinds of software, but the exact contours of that coexistence are far from settled. Zuckerberg’s advocacy for open-source AI could influence other companies to adopt similar approaches, fostering a more collaborative and inclusive AI development environment. However, the ultimate trajectory of AI development will depend on various factors, including technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and market dynamics.“I believe that open source is necessary for a positive AI future. AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and scientific research,” Zuckerberg wrote. “Open source\n",
      "\n",
      "will ensure that more people around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of AI, that power isn’t concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and safely across society.\"You might also like.Meta AI vs ChatGPT vs Google Gemini: we tell you which chatbot is the bestMeta rolls out new Meta AI website, and it might just bury Microsoft and Google's AI dreamsMeta AI's latest feature can show you in a fantasy world – if you feed it your face Eric Hal SchwartzContributorEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.

      "OpenAI may be working on AI that can perform research without human help – which should go fine | TechRadar Skip to main content (Image credit: Shutterstock/Daniel Chetroni) OpenAI is developing a new project to enhance its AI models' reasoning capabilities, called “Strawberry,” according to documents first discovered by Reuters. The project is a key element in the efforts by OpenAI to achieve more powerful AI models capable of operating on their own when it comes to performing research.According to the internal documents Reuters looked at, Strawberry is aimed at building an AI that will not only answer questions but search around online and perform follow-up research on its own. This so-called “deep research” trick would be a major leap beyond current AI models that rely on existing data sets and respond in ways that are already programmed. There aren't details on the exact mechanisms of Strawberry, but apparently, it involves AI models using a specialized processing method after training on extensive datasets. This innovative approach could potentially set a new standard in AI development. An AI that can think ahead and perform research on its own to understand the world is much closer to a human than anything ChatGPT or other tools using AI models offer. It's a challenging goal that has eluded AI developers to date, despite numerous advancements in the field.Reuters reported that Strawberry, which was then known as Q*, had made some breakthroughs. There were demonstrations where viewers witnessed AI could tackle science and math problems beyond the range of commercial models, and apparently, OpenAI had tested AI models that scored over 90% on a championship-level math problem data set.Think AheadShould OpenAI achieve its goals, the reasoning capabilities could transform scientific research and everyday problem-solving.

      "Google I/O 2024 – the 7 biggest AI announcements, from Gemini to Android 15 | TechRadar Skip to main content (Image credit: Google / Future) The dust has now settled on the Google I/O 2024 keynote and there's no doubting what the big theme was – Google Gemini and new AI tools completely dominated the announcements, giving us a glimpse of where our digital lives are headed. CEO Sundar Pichai was right to describe the event as its version of The Eras Tour – specifically, the \"Gemini Era\" – at the very top. Unlike previous years, the entire keynote was about Gemini and AI; in fact, Google said the latter a total of 121 times. From unveiling a futuristic AI assistant called \"Project Astra\" that can run on a phone – and maybe smart glasses, one day – to Gemini being infused into nearly every service or product the company offers, artificial intelligence was definitely the dominant theme. The two-hour keynote was enough to melt the mind of all but the most ardent LLM enthusiast, so we've broken down the 7 most important things that Google announced during its main I/O 2024 keynote – and included the latest news on when we actually might see these new tools.1. Google dropped Project Astra – an “AI agent” for everyday lifeSo it turns out that Google does have an answer to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Microsoft’s CoPilot. Project Astra, dubbed as an \"AI agent\" for everyday life, is essentially Google Lens on steroids and looks seriously impressive, able to understand, reason, and respond to live video and audio. Demoed on a Pixel phone in a recorded video, the user was seen walking around an office, providing a live feed of the rear camera and asking Astra questions off the cuff. Gemini was viewing and understanding the visuals while also tackling the questions. It speaks to the multi-modal and long-context in the backend of Gemini, which works in a jiffy to identify and deliver a response quickly. In the demonstration, it knew what a specific part of a speaker was and could even\n",

      "Will Apple go big on AI at WWDC 2024? Almost certainly – but it could ‘think different’ | TechRadar Skip to main content (Image credit: Shutterstock / Yuganov Konstantin) You can’t swing a metaphorical cat in a virtual room without some tech-savvy person harping on about AI. And over the past year and a bit, AI interest has exploded thanks to the rise of generative AI; for the uninitiated, that’s smart algorithms and modes that can basically create things from various commands and inputs rather than acting as a smart assistant. As such, we saw the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro go hard on generative AI, specifically with its Magic Editor and smart features that can pretty much handle calls for you. Samsung then did the same with the Galaxy S24 series, on which the rather snazzy Circle to Search AI feature made its debut. Google I/O was a feast of AI announcements and forward-thinking, with Gemini AI in the limelight. Here's how to watch WWDC 2024So that leads me to think, what will Apple do with AI and generative AI at WWDC 2024? The crew at Cupertino will surely talk about AI, given we’ve seen it crop up with the launch of the new iPad Air and OLED iPad Pro models both with the M4 chip that has been designed for running AI workloads. But will it also go deep into generative AI in the same vein as Google? That’s a trickier question to answer – not that I can answer it, as Apple is super tight-lipped about nearly everything, so this is all educated speculation. However, I’d place a hefty bet that Apple will indeed go big on AI, but it’ll do it in a slightly different way to its rival; it’ll ‘think different’ if you’ll allow the wry joke. Seamless and consumer focussed (Image credit: Future /ChatGPT)While Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is, as its name suggests, a developer-centric showcase, it’s also distinctly consumer-tinged. All the announcements ultimately have Apple’s end users in mind, which means the likes of you and I, and creative types who use\n",

      "iOS, it just became something I use without thinking. Apple’s ability to make new features that might seem a tad ‘meh’ suddenly useful and frictionless to use is something many other tech brands could keep learning from.Going alone or partnering up? (Image credit: Shutterstock)The other question about Apple and AI at WWDC 2024 is whether Apple will use in-house AI models or partner with external generative AI developers. Apple is no stranger to AI, as machine-learning tech has been used for multiple generations of iPhone to help deliver the best phone photos. But the best generative AI tech will surely need multimodal models – whereby data can be harvested from multiple sources and sensors and then processed together – which could see Apple step outside its walled garden and look for help. Such help has been tipped to come from OpenAI and its ChatGPT models, though there was also some murmurings Apple could turn to Google’s Gemini AI. It’s standard practice to see Apple as the company that does its own thing. But I can see it joining forces with one of the big AI players to tap into trained AI models while it provides the customer experience and hardware that's so appealing to millions of people worldwide.Ultimately, this is all pondering on my part based on nearly a decade of working in technology journalism, so I could be completely wrong about how Apple approaches AI and the thrust of WWDC this year. But I’m confident in my predictions and reckon this will be a conference to watch. Speaking of which, if you want to watch the keynote live, check out our guide on how to watch WWDC 2024. Equally, if you want all the latest news from WWDC, including rumors in the run-up to it, you’re in the right place – TechRadar will also be attending the conference, so make sure to check back here for more news, views and analysis.

      "MacBooks at fancy coffee shops. By that, I mean generative AI tools will be neatly integrated into Apple’s platforms. I’m thinking agendas automatically developed and popped into your iPhone’s notifications as AI tech peruses your calendar and emails – with your permission of course. Slick auto editing for videos and photos that transform mediocre shots into something more presentable at the tap of a button, or even serving up suggestions in real time. Clever fitness features that can customize workout and diet plans for you via data sucked from your iPhone and Apple Watch sensors. Smartly turned playlists created on the fly in Apple Music via a simple directive of ‘make me a playlist for a summer party.’ Auto-generated summaries of meetings, calls, presentations, or even the latest Apple TV Plus show. And smarter searching, web page summaries, and information surfacing in Safari and across iOS 18 and macOS. Furthermore, we can expect a big AI upgrade for Siri. Not only has that been rumored with the idea that Apple’s virtual assistant could tap into the likes of ChatGPT, but Siri is arguably the dunce of the virtual assistants when compared to Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant, so it’s well overdue a dose of new smarts. The overall idea here is that Apple will surely make generative AI tools feel more like part of the experience of using an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or Apple Watch rather than having features that you have to actively search for or enable, something that’s arguably the case with the aforementioned Pixel and Galaxy phones. And I feel that’s the key to getting the general public interested in actually using AI in a holistic way. It’ll be all about making it feel natural and useful rather than a nice to have or an ‘oh that’s cool’ feature that one only uses once. I think this in the context of the iPhone 15 Pro’s Action button – at first, it seemed a tad pointless given its limited scope, but once I set it up to trigger the flashlight function in\n",

       "\n",
       "Artificial Intelligence continues to revolutionize the tech industry, and developers are at the forefront of this transformation. From productivity gains to open-source advocacy, the latest developments in AI are shaping how technology evolves. Here are the top five AI news stories for developers in 2024.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Developers Aren't Worried About AI Taking Their Jobs — But Excited About Productivity Gains\n",
       "\n",
       "Recent research indicates that three out of four (76%) workers are now integrating AI tools into their daily workflows. According to Stack Overflow's Developer Survey, which surveyed over 65,000 developers from 185 countries, AI is seen more as a supportive tool than a job threat. Despite the growing use of AI, only 43% of developers completely trust its accuracy, a slight increase from last year's findings.\n",
       "\n",
       "While AI struggles with more complex tasks, developers are optimistic about its impact on productivity. A significant 81% of developers reported increased productivity as the primary benefit of AI, with 71% of new coders finding that AI accelerates their learning process. Stack Overflow's Chief Product Officer, Ryan Polk, emphasized that while Generative AI (GenAI) is powerful, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution for technological challenges.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, concerns remain prevalent, with 79% of developers worried about AI spreading misinformation, 65% about incorrect data attribution, and 50% about bias. Despite these concerns, 70% of professional developers do not see AI as a threat to their job security. Companies are encouraged to consider these perceptions to better integrate AI into workflows and enhance productivity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Craig Hale, a tech and automotive writer with a keen interest in AI and machine learning, authored the article, highlighting the balance between AI's potential benefits and its current limitations. As AI continues to evolve, developers' insights will be crucial in navigating its integration into various industries.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Mark Zuckerberg Claims Open-Source Is 'Necessary for a Positive AI Future'\n",
       "\n",
       "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has taken a firm stance on the necessity of open-source models for the future of generative AI. In his advocacy, Zuckerberg criticizes closed-source developers like OpenAI and Google for restricting technological access, which he believes hampers innovation. He argues that open-source models foster collaborative development, unlike their closed-source counterparts, which are limited to internal teams and select customers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Zuckerberg draws a comparison between open-source Android and Apple's proprietary iOS to illustrate the accessibility differences. Closed-source AI models, such as those from OpenAI and Google, offer limited opportunities for modification, thereby protecting their intellectual property. However, Zuckerberg contends that an open-source framework allows for faster and more effective refinement of AI technologies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Acknowledging the risks of malicious use, Zuckerberg nevertheless emphasizes that closed-source models are not immune to such threats. Meta's commitment to open-source is evident through its Llama AI model portfolio, with Llama 3.1 being one of the most advanced iterations. By making these models open-source, Zuckerberg believes that a broader developer base can contribute, enhancing robustness and security.\n",
       "\n",
       "The essay concludes that open-source AI democratizes development, ensuring that the benefits are widely distributed rather than concentrated in a few companies. This approach is seen as essential for a positive AI future, fostering innovation and collaboration across the global tech community.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. OpenAI May Be Working on AI That Can Perform Research Without Human Help\n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI is reportedly developing a groundbreaking project named \"Strawberry,\" aimed at enhancing AI models' reasoning capabilities. The primary goal of Strawberry is to create AI that can independently conduct follow-up research, moving beyond the current models' dependency on existing datasets. This involves a specialized post-training processing method on extensive datasets, setting new benchmarks in AI development.\n",
       "\n",
       "Strawberry has shown promise in handling complex science and math problems that current commercial models cannot. Internal documents from OpenAI reveal that Strawberry, initially known as Q*, has achieved significant breakthroughs, including scoring over 90% on championship-level math problem datasets. If successful, Strawberry could revolutionize scientific research and problem-solving by autonomously filling knowledge gaps and proposing hypotheses.\n",
       "\n",
       "This project aligns with OpenAI's long-term vision of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Despite the advancements seen with GPT-3 and GPT-4, Strawberry represents a significant leap toward autonomous reasoning and deep research capabilities. The development of Strawberry could mark a pivotal moment in AI research, bringing us closer to truly autonomous AI systems capable of independent scientific inquiry.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Google I/O 2024 – The 7 Biggest AI Announcements\n",
       "\n",
       "Google I/O 2024 was a landmark event, with CEO Sundar Pichai declaring it the \"Gemini Era\" due to the focus on AI advancements. The keynote featured significant announcements, primarily centered around Google Gemini and new AI tools. One of the standout introductions was Project Astra, an \"AI agent\" designed to understand, reason, and respond to live video and audio inputs.\n",
